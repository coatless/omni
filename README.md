## omni

<!-- badges: start -->

[![Travis build
status](https://travis-ci.com/coatless/omni.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/coatless/omni)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of omni is to provide pre-defined schemes to use with
omnigraffle from *R*.

The idea for the package and some initial code structure came from [Bob
Rudis’](https://rud.is/b/) post regarding [Spelunking macOS ‘ScreenTime’
App Usage with
R](https://rud.is/b/2019/10/28/spelunking-macos-screentime-app-usage-with-r/).

### Installation

You can install the released version of omni from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("omni")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("coatless/omni")
```

### Usage

To use `omni`, load the package with:

``` r
library(omni)
```

Todo: Add an example with `data.frame` and `list`.
